# Abstraction and Encapsulation Reader
Through the use of three Python classes —"Fan", "Car", and "Pet"— this repository illustrates the ideas of abstraction and encapsulation. Each class has constructor procedures, attributes, and represents a particular entity.

## Fan Class
The 'Fan' class depicts a fan and enables for setting and retrieval of the fan's speed, on/off state, radius, and color. The test program "TestFan" creates two fan objects and displays their properties. It has a constructor that initializes these attributes.

## Car Class
The properties of the car's year, model, make, and current speed are included in the Car class, which represents a car. It offers ways to speed up, slow down, and recover the vehicle's current speed. By generating a car object, calling the accelerate method five times, displaying the speed after each call, and then calling the brake method five times, displaying the speed after each brake, the program illustrates how to use these methods. 

## Pet Class
The name, animal type, and age of pet are all represented by the Pet class, which also contains other features. It offers ways to configure and get these characteristics. The application asks the user to provide information about the pet, creates a Pet object, sets the properties using the input, and then uses the getter methods to display the pet's data.

Overall, by developing classes with clearly defined characteristics and methods, maintaining data integrity, and allowing limited access to the class properties, the repository serves as an example of the ideas of abstraction and encapsulation.
