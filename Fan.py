#Three constants named SLOW, MEDIUM, and FAST with the values 1, 2, 3 to denote the fan speed.
#A private int data field named on that specifies the speed of the fan.
#A private bool data field named on that specifies whether the fan is on (the default is False).
#A private float field named radius that specifies the radius of the fan.
#A private string data field named color that specifies the color of the fan
#The accessor(getters) methods for all four data fields.
#The mutator(setters) methods for all four data fields.
